Example:

Sample Size: n = 5

Sum ( Σx ) : 242

Sum of squares ( Σx^2 ) : 12062


->
Ok. We know n=5
X1,X2,X3,X4,X5

Sum of the Σx is 242, means X1+X2+X3+X4+X5=242
Sum of squares Σx^2 is 12062, means X1^2+X2^2+X3^2+X4^2+X5^2=12062

Calculate Sample Variance:
S^2 = (1/(n-1))(Σx^2-(Σx^2/n))

We can use r code to easily solve this question:

> n = 5
> s = 242
> ss = 12062
> v = (1/(n-1))*(ss-(s^2)/n)
> print(v)
[1] 87.3

Easy and neat!
